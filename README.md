I developed an application in React to calculate the Christmas bonus to be received in El Salvador.
I created without watching tutorials, without watching courses, only with what I am learning.

Disclaimer: to verify the bonus to be received, please consult the official government channels as this project was created for practice and may contain differences from the actual amount to be received.
